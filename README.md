***Introduction***

Efficient team collaboration is key to project success. An event calendar can greatly aid in this by keeping everyone organized and informed. This guide will show you how to set up an event calendar for team collaboration using GitHub, a versatile platform known for its version control and collaboration features. By the end, you'll have a functional calendar to streamline your team's efforts.

***Software/Requirements***

* **GitHub Account:** You need a GitHub account to create repositories and manage your event calendar.

* **Android Device:** While not strictly necessary, an Android device can be used to access and manage your GitHub repositories.

* **Calendar Application:** You'll need a calendar application that supports the iCalendar format (.ics) for displaying events.

***Procedure***

* **Create a New Repository:** Log in to your GitHub account and create a new repository for your event calendar.

* **Add Calendar Events:** Create a new file in your repository with an .ics extension and add your calendar events using the iCalendar format.

* **Commit Changes:** Commit the changes to your repository to save the events.Share the Calendar: Share the URL of your repository's .ics file with your team members so they can subscribe to the calendar using their preferred calendar application.

* **Subscribe to the Calendar:** Team members can subscribe to the calendar by adding the URL to their calendar application. This will display the events on their calendar.

***Conclusion*** In summary, setting up an event calendar on GitHub has improved team collaboration. Despite initial challenges, we now have a robust system in place. Going forward, we should update and integrate the calendar with other tools, provide training, and encourage team adoption for optimal results.
